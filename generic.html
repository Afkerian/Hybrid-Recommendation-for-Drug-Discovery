				<span class="image fit"><img alt="" src="images/pic04.png" /></span>
				<p>Hybrid Recommendation for Drug Discovery is a state-of-the-art machine learning model designed to aid
					in the discovery of new drugs. It works by taking a set of numerical values as inputs, which
					represent various properties of potential drug compounds. These could be physical or chemical
					properties, such as molecular weight, solubility, or the presence of certain functional groups.</p>
				<p>The 'Hybrid' in its name refers to the combination of different types of recommendation techniques
					that this model uses. Specifically, it combines content-based techniques, which use features of the
					compounds, with collaborative filtering techniques, which use past interactions between different
					compounds and experimental results. By combining these techniques, the model can provide a more
					complete and accurate view of potential drug candidates.</p>
				<p>This approach can greatly speed up the process of drug discovery by allowing researchers to explore a
					wider space of possibilities and direct their efforts more efficiently. As more data is collected,
					the model can improve and provide even more accurate recommendations. The ultimate goal is to aid in
					the identification of new, effective drugs that can then be taken forward into clinical trials and,
					ultimately, used to treat patients.</p>
